## Free System Examples

In this folder there is an example demonstrating simulations of a free system

With the absence of a system-environment interacton, the system is completely
deterministic, and obeys the schrodinger equation.

In `free_system.py` this feature is put to the test - we run both a stochastic
and deterministic simulation. They should give the same result!
