## Caldeira Leggett Environment Examples

In this folder there are a series of example demonstrating simulations using the Caldeira-leggett model

In contrast to the `periodic_caldeira_leggett` method, this uses a linear interation
to approximate the system-environment interaction, and we must therefore use non-periodic
boundary conditions to prevent collapse of the simulation.

In `stochastic_schrodinger.py` we have a simple example of simulating a particle
in a harmonic well.
